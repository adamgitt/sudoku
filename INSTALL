To install simply run

python setup.py install

as root.

Assuming all goes well, you can now run GNOME Sudoku by typing
gnome-sudoku at the commandline or by selecting "Sudoku" from the
"Games" section of your "Applications" menu.

You can use --prefix to change the base of your installation (the default will be /usr/)

REQUIREMENTS

Python 2.4

Relatively recent GNOME and gtk libraries (pygtk 2.6 will definitely
work; 2.4 may or may not work).

Python Imaging Library (PIL)

Maybe something else -- this is the first version to make it into the
world, so I may well be forgetting some requirements!
